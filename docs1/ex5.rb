# Large Numbers

# Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

# Tried the docs, but that didn't work as I didn't know where to look.

# Google was much faster!

# Found answer at: https://www.rubytapas.com/2018/05/29/make-big-numbers-readable-in-ruby/

# In Ruby, we can use underscores to separate numbers to make them easier to read.

1000000000

# can be written as:

1_000_000_000

# I did not use the hint.

# Once I used the hint and looked under literals, I could quickly see the answer as I already knew what to look for.

# From the docs:

# Numbers
# You can write integers of any size as follows:

1234
1_234

# These numbers have the same value, 1,234. The underscore may be used to enhance readability for humans. You may place an underscore anywhere in the number.
