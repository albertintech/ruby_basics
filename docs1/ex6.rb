# Symbol Syntax

# Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

# Ruby docs under literals say you may reference a symbol using a colon:

:my_symbol.

# So, to answer the question above:

:Albert
